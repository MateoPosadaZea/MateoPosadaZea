# Mateo Posada — Frontend Developer in progress 👋

I’m a UI/UX-minded web developer transitioning from brand & web design to modern frontend.  
I care about clean structure, accessibility, and craft. Currently studying at **TripleTen Web Dev** and building in public.

- 🧭 **Goal (2025–2026):** land remote US-based frontend work and grow **Mattriz Studio** into a lean product/design shop.
- 🎓 **Background:** 6+ years designing visual identities & websites (Webflow/WordPress, SEO, e-commerce).
- 🌍 **Based in:** Bogotá (UTC-5) · open to remote 

---

## What I’m focusing on now
- HTML/CSS architecture (semantic landmarks, Grid/Flex, tokens)
- Modern JavaScript (DOM, modules, fetch, accessibility patterns)
- React + Vite (state, effects, API data, component design)
- Node/Express basics (REST, validation, testing)
- “Developer hygiene”: readable commits, docs, and small PRs


## Toolbox
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS (Grid/Flex/Tailwind), JavaScript (ES202x)
- **Frontend:** React, Vite
- **Backend (basics):** Node.js, Express
- **Quality:** Jest, ESLint/Prettier, Git & GitHub, GitHub Actions
- **CMS / No-code:** Webflow, WordPress/WooCommerce, Shopify
- **SEO & A11y:** On-page SEO, Accessibility (WCAG)

---

## How I work
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`)
- PRs over direct pushes (even solo) to keep history reviewable
- Lint & format on CI; checklists for a11y (labels, focus, contrasts, keyboard)
- Short READMEs with setup steps and screenshots

---

## Beyond code
- I run **Mattriz Studio**—design + web for small/medium businesses.
- Into product thinking, systems, and details that compound over time.
- Recovering footballer 🦿, learning calisthenics, and rebuilding consistency.
