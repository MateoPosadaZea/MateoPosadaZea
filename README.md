# Mateo Posada — Frontend Developer in progress 👋

I’m a UI/UX-minded web developer transitioning from brand & web design to modern frontend.  
I care about clean structure, accessibility, and craft. Currently studying at **TripleTen Web Dev** and building in public.

- 🧭 **Goal (2025–2026):** land remote US-based frontend work and grow **Mattriz Studio** into a lean product/design/development studio.
- 🎓 **Background:** 6+ years designing visual identities & websites (Webflow/WordPress, SEO, e-commerce).
- 🌍 **Based in:** Bogotá (UTC-5) · open to remote

## What I’m focusing on now
- Semantics & accessibility (WCAG), BEM, Grid/Flex, responsive.
- JavaScript: DOM, events, fetch/JSON, modules.
- Git/GitHub: branches, PRs, readable commits, GitHub Pages.


## Toolbox
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES202x)  
- **Tooling:** Webpack, NPM Scripts, ESLint/Prettier  
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub (Pages, Actions)

## How I work
- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`) + small, focused PRs
- **PRs over direct pushes** (even solo) to keep a reviewable history
- **Semantic HTML + BEM**; layout with **Grid/Flex**; tokens for spacing/type
- **Accessibility first**: labels/landmarks, keyboard/focus, contrast checks
- **Lint & format** with ESLint/Prettier; no warnings on commit
- **Project READMEs**: one-screen setup, *Live demo* link (GitHub Pages), and screenshot
- **GitHub hygiene**: clear repo names + topics; pinned showcase repos
- **Daily shipping**: incremental commits, changelog-style messages
- **Tooling (course-aligned)**: Webpack as default; exploring Vite on side projects
- **Collab**: open to pair programming / code reviews; issues for todos & roadmap

---

## Beyond code
- I run **Mattriz Studio**—design + web for small/medium businesses.
- Into product thinking, systems, and details that compound over time.
- Recovering footballer 🦿, learning calisthenics, and rebuilding consistency.
